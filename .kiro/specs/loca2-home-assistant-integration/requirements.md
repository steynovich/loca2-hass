# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a Home Assistant integration that tracks the location of Loca2 devices through their RESTful API. The integration will be compatible with the Home Assistant Community Store (HACS) for easy installation and updates. Users will be able to monitor their Loca2 devices as device trackers within Home Assistant, enabling location-based automations and monitoring.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Home Assistant user, I want to install the Loca2 integration through HACS, so that I can easily manage and update the integration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the integration is published THEN it SHALL be discoverable and installable through HACS
2. WHEN a user searches for "Loca2" in HACS THEN the integration SHALL appear in the search results
3. WHEN the integration is installed via HACS THEN it SHALL be properly registered with Home Assistant
4. WHEN updates are available THEN HACS SHALL notify users and allow easy updating

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Home Assistant user, I want to configure the Loca2 integration with my API credentials, so that I can connect to my Loca2 account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the integration THEN the system SHALL prompt for API endpoint URL and authentication credentials
2. WHEN invalid credentials are provided THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message
3. WHEN valid credentials are provided THEN the system SHALL successfully authenticate with the Loca2 API
4. IF the API connection fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
5. WHEN configuration is complete THEN the integration SHALL store credentials securely

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Home Assistant user, I want to see my Loca2 devices as device trackers, so that I can monitor their locations in Home Assistant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the integration is configured THEN it SHALL discover all Loca2 devices associated with the account
2. WHEN a Loca2 device is discovered THEN it SHALL be created as a device_tracker entity in Home Assistant
3. WHEN a device location is updated THEN the device_tracker entity SHALL reflect the new coordinates
4. WHEN a device goes offline THEN the device_tracker SHALL show "not_home" or "unavailable" status
5. WHEN a device comes back online THEN the device_tracker SHALL resume normal location reporting

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Home Assistant user, I want the integration to automatically update device locations, so that I have real-time tracking information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the integration starts THEN it SHALL begin polling the Loca2 API at configurable intervals
2. WHEN location data is retrieved THEN it SHALL update the corresponding device_tracker entities
3. IF API rate limits are encountered THEN the system SHALL respect the limits and adjust polling frequency
4. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and retry
5. WHEN the integration is reloaded THEN it SHALL resume tracking without losing device states

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Home Assistant user, I want to configure polling intervals and other settings, so that I can optimize performance and API usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the integration THEN users SHALL be able to set custom polling intervals
2. WHEN the polling interval is changed THEN the integration SHALL apply the new interval without restart
3. WHEN API usage approaches limits THEN the system SHALL log warnings
4. IF users want to disable specific devices THEN they SHALL be able to do so through configuration
5. WHEN configuration options are invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear validation messages

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a Home Assistant user, I want the integration to provide device attributes and diagnostics, so that I can troubleshoot issues and get detailed device information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a device is tracked THEN it SHALL expose attributes like battery level, last seen, and accuracy
2. WHEN diagnostic information is needed THEN the integration SHALL provide API response times and error counts
3. WHEN devices have additional metadata THEN it SHALL be available as entity attributes
4. IF API errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with appropriate detail levels
5. WHEN the integration status is checked THEN it SHALL report connection health and last successful update

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the integration to follow Home Assistant best practices, so that it integrates seamlessly with the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the integration is loaded THEN it SHALL follow Home Assistant's integration structure and conventions
2. WHEN entities are created THEN they SHALL have proper unique IDs and device information
3. WHEN the integration handles errors THEN it SHALL use Home Assistant's logging framework
4. WHEN configuration is managed THEN it SHALL use Home Assistant's config flow pattern
5. WHEN the integration is unloaded THEN it SHALL clean up resources properly
6. WHEN API calls are made THEN they SHALL use async/await patterns for non-blocking operations
7. WHEN the integration performs I/O operations THEN they SHALL be implemented asynchronously to prevent blocking the event loop
